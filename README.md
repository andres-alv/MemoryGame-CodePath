## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   I faced a few challenges throughout this project. After working mainly with Python for my major-related courses, I found myself having trouble remembering
   the syntax for Javascript and working with CSS to style the webpage. Though, I feel like the latter took me much longer to figure out. With Javascript, all
   I needed was a quick refresher, and I was able to iron out all the problems I was having, with the occasional peek at MDN. However, working with CSS has always
   been fun and frustrating when I work on anything web development-related because it's not as intuitive to me. I was having trouble getting the images to work
   only when a button was pressed or lit up. At first, I misunderstood optional task 5 and thought I just had to decorate the buttons with images. Then upon
   ereading the tasks, I realized my mistake. So I began working on what seemed simple enough, but it wasn't. I tried finding something online but couldn't find
   exactly what I needed. So instead, I looked up keywords for what I knew I had to do and piece it together. I surfed through MDN Web Docs and W3Schools for Javascript
   and CSS to help roll the project out sooner. As frustrating as it was, moments like those remind me of why I enjoy this hobby so much; being a problem solver is rewarding in so many ways!

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   I'm curious about how sensitive information is kept secure and web applications. In my intro to web development class, I studied website vulnerability, where we learned about the many vulnerabilities
   of using WordPress. It was a brief, surface-level overview of the topic, but it sparked my interest in studying more and becoming interested in the cybersecurity field.
   For my question on web dev, Are web developers/software developers given the appropriate training to ensure that they secure the application they are creating? And if so, how does it work?
   I cannot even imagine putting together an application together with a team and having to make sure no one leaves vulnerabilities in the software they create.
   I know this isn't what the assignment is about, but this is an area I'm interested in working in in the future.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   If I had a few more hours for this project, I would add the following features: a visual strike counter for the user, a time countdown, a win, a game over screen, and a difficulty setting.
   A visible strike counter would need to keep track of the number of mistakes variable I have and display it to the user. As for the game over and game win screens, I think having a separate
   screen display would help make the game feel more interactive. Finally, I feel like a difficulty setting goes even further, keeping people engaged with the user being able to control the game's flow.
   Apart from features, I feel like this game can grow even more if it's more appealing to the eyes. I would use custom-made art for the different screens as I've done with Canva and use consistent art for the images
   on the buttons. I think these additions would benefit the game even better.
